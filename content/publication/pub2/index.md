abstract: "Parks and greenways provide many benefits to urban communities, but their relationship  to  crime  is  often  debated.  We  examined  the  links  between  an  elevated  linear  trail  and  crime  within  census  block  groups  (CBGs)  surrounding Chicago’s Bloomingdale Trail, colloquially known as The 606, using  two  different  approaches:  (a)  a  matched  case-control  comparison  of crime trends in 606-proximate CBGs and similar socioeconomic status (SES)  neighborhoods  in  other  parts  of  the  city  and  (b)  spatially  oriented  hierarchical  regression  models  of  crime  in  606-proximate  CBGs  before  and after trail construction. Using this dichotomous approach, we detected a  positive  influence  of  The  606  on  all  types  of  crime  (violent,  property,  and  disorderly)  when  examined  at  a  coarse  scale,  particularly  in  low  SES  neighborhoods (Study 1), and an inverse relationship between trail proximity and property crime on a spatially proximate scale (Study 2). Future research should continue to explore complex relationships between urban greenways and crime in diverse cities."

summary: Parks and greenways provide many benefits to urban communities, but their relationship  to  crime  is  often  debated.  We  examined  the  links  between  an  elevated  linear  trail  and  crime  within  census  block  groups  (CBGs)  surrounding Chicago’s Bloomingdale Trail, colloquially known as The 606.
