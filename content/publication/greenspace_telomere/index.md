abstract: "The exposome, reflecting the range of environmental exposures individuals encounter throughout their life, can  influence a variety of health outcomes and can play a role in how the environment impacts our genes. Telomeres,  genetic structures regulating cell growth and senescence, are one pathway through which the exposome  may  impact health.  Greenspace  exposure, representing  the  amount  of  green areas  in  one’s  neighborhood, is  one  component of the exposome and has been associated with multiple health benefits. To investigate the potential  link between greenspace exposure and telomere length, we analyzed data from the 1999–2001 National Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey  (NHANES)  sample.  Our  study  examined  individual,  risk,  and  contextual  factors. We found that greater greenspace exposure in one’ s neighborhood was associated with longer telomere  lengths when  considering individual  and  risk factors,  suggesting a positive effect of living  in greener neigh- borhoods. However, this relationship became non-significant when contextual factors, such as air pollution and deprivation, were included in the analysis. These findings highlight a complex relationship between greenspace  and telomere length, warranting further research to explore contextual factors in detail."
