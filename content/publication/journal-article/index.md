abstract: "Introduction: Crime and the fear of crime can be a barrier to park use, and loca-tions of crimes can have varied effects. Unsafe areas in or aroundthe park, around the residence, or along the route to the park canalter park use behavior. Our study aimed to examine associationsbetween objective measures of types and location of crimes andpark use behaviors. Methods: In 2013 we surveyed a sample (N = 230) of residents in Greens-boro, North Carolina, about park use, with responses matched toobjective crime and spatial measures. We measured all crimes andviolent crimes near home, near the closest park, and along theshortest route between home and park. By using ordered and bin-ary logistic modeling, we examined the relationships between thelocations of crime and park use and duration of park visit, park rat-ing, and never visiting parks. Additional models included distanceto the closest park. Results: Increased crime in parks and near home was associated with fewer park visits. Greater violent crime in all locations was related tofewer park visits. Park ratings were lower for parks with high violent crime rates. Conclusion: Given the importance of parks as settings for outdoor recreationand physical activity, crime may have a detrimental effect on physical activity and, therefore, public health."
