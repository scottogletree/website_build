summary: Mapping the flow of bicycle share trips in Denver, CO
title: Denver BCycle Flows
---

I came across some data on bike share trips from the Denver BCycle program, and a nice analysis by Tyler Byers [here](http://datawrangl.com/2016/02/21/denver-bcycle/)

So I fetched the data and made a plot that is more like art, based on work by Dr. James Cheshire [here](http://spatial.ly/2015/03/mapping-flows/)
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="flow_plot.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 1000px;"/></div>


The code is at [bcycle_flow.r](https://github.com/scottogletree/codebits/)

A little extra work was done in Adobe Illustrator.

The data is at [Denver BCycle](https://www.denverbcycle.com/company)
