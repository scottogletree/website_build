summary: Some sources of information
---

These are some listservs that might be of interest to people at the intersection of social and ecological fields. I would have liked to know about them earlier in my PhD journey so here they are for others.

### [ECOLOG](https://listserv.umd.edu/archives/ecolog-l.html)

This is an ecology focused listserv but will have opportunities and announcements that sometimes cross over fields.

### [USIALE](http://listserv.uri.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=USIALE-L)

This is the discussion board for the US chapter of the International Association for Landscape Ecology (IALE).

### [Recreation Ecology](http://lists.ncsu.edu/cgi-bin/digest?list=rececol)

This is the listserv for the Recration Ecology Research Network.

### [Earth Sciences Job Board](http://mailman.ucar.edu/pipermail/es_jobs_net/)

Looks to be just opportunities in the earth sciences, that's helpful.

### [Society for Conservation GIS](https://www.scgis.org/content/discussions/listserv-faq)

You have to sign up for this one.

### [ASU GIS](https://lists.asu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=ASUGIS-L)

This is out of Arizona State, but has opportunities in the region.

### [SPRENET](https://listserv.uga.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=sprenet)

You have to login to this one. SPRENET is popular in the recreation field.

*(I'll add more as I find them)*
