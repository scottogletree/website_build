System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC) is a tool for measuring activity in parks. Researchers have used SOPARC in a variety of setting and for this project we are combining the data from 3 separate studies done in New York City. Despite an established protocol each study adjusted the SOPARC tool to their project. We hope to be able to combine each dataset into one grand dataset to understand broader patterns in park use in NYC.
