This paper details issues of access to land records from traditional land record institutions within US counties, focusing on conservation easements (CEs), CE geospatial data, and tax-assessment data. This paper also explores the issue of privacy related to CE land records and land trusts, the primary type of non-profit that holds CEs. Previous literature has cited landowner concerns about privacy as a driving force behind land trust?s hesitancies to share information. However, we find evidence that landowner privacy concerns may be overestimated and more nuanced than previously reported. Additionally, we document widespread issues related to access of CE documents from register of deed?s offices. This paper supports reforms to better track CEs within register of deeds offices and reforms to make land records data more accessible for pluralistic societal needs and to support inclusion in environmental governance.","tags":["Conservation easements","Conservation planning","Land records","Land trusts","Open data","Private landowners"],"title":"Evaluating Conservation Easement and Land Records Datain Rapidly Growing Counties in the United States and theImplications for Environmental Governance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We received a pilot project grant for $36,000 to investigate the relationship between greenspace and telomere length in the NHANES data. I led the conceptualization, writing, and submittal of this project to the Center for Human Health and the Environment at NC State. Along with Dr. Aaron Hipp, Dr. David Reif, and Dr. Lin Yang we will be looking at what can be learned about how our environment influences health at the level of DNA.\nProject Description\nGreenspaces, composed of vegetation such as lawns, street trees, and parks, are associated with a variety of benefits to mental and physical health. The effect of green, vegetated landscapes on human health has been investigated from the level of specific health behaviors and outcomes, self-reported measures of well being, and quality of life, but little work has been able to identify biological mechanisms behind these associations. Our proposed project will investigate a pathway that greenspace environments might influence health at the cellular level, through the preservation of telomere length. Telomeres are structures on the ends of DNA and play a role in cell regeneration and aging. The length of telomeres can be impacted by stressors in the environment and could be an epigenetic factor in disease and individual health. Greenspace is an environmental condition that varies across residential areas and could influence telomere length through stress regulation, physical activity opportunities, air quality improvements, or other impacts. Little research has been done on the relationship that environmental greenspace may have on telomere length, and therefore disease, cellular health, and aging. This project will use data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to establish an initial investigation of the relationship. NHANES 1999-2002 collected biospecimens from which telomere length was determined for approximately 7,500 individuals. Using the extensive examination and laboratory data from NHANES combined with time-matched environmental data on greenspace exposure from satellite imagery, this study will serve as a pilot project to investigate the association of the greenspace environment and telomere length. Participant residential geolocation is restricted in the NHANES data, but is available from the National Center for Health Statistics Research Data Centers. Accessing this location data will allow for measurement of local greenspace exposure to combine with available NHANES data on telomere length and covariates to facilitate analysis. Findings of this retrospective study will inform the research gaps and aims to submit an NIH R01 or R21 focused on the effects of environmental greenspace on public health and telomere length. The pilot study will serve as a means of revealing potential questions and causal mechanisms to inform a future study as well as provide new cross-university collaborations between Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Management and Biological Sciences.\n","date":1618358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618358400,"objectID":"5e596a63de73991028851670a4a60a69","permalink":"/project/greenspace_telomere/","publishdate":"2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/greenspace_telomere/","section":"project","summary":"Grant funded research","tags":null,"title":"Greenspace and Telomere Length","type":"project"},{"authors":["Scott Ogletree"],"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to explore more possibilities in databases and spatial data since working on a large data project during my PhD.

After some internet work I found some handy sources for running databases in containers and so I thought I would try it out as a platform for learning more.\nHere is my effort to get a database up and running in a container and then connect to said database with Dbeaver and then QGIS.\nDownload and install Docker; Download and install Dbeaver Community Edition; Download and install QGIS\n Get a PostGreSQL database running in a container  At the terminal type: docker container run -d --name=pg -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -e PGDATA=/pgdata -v /pgdata:/pgdata postgres  This will download (if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist on your machine) the image from docker and start it up. You will now have running a container with a PostGres database active. Some explanation of the command  -d means the container will run in the background -name=pg names the container, rather than docker assigning a random name -p 5432:5432 assigns port 5432 of the container to 5432 on the host. You will connect to the PostGres database through this port -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker is an environment variable for PostGres, it sets the password to docker in this case -e PGDATA=/pgdata sets the data location for the database in the container to the folder /pgdata. This folder will be created in the container. -v /pgdata:/pgdata sets a volume connection from inside the container to a location on the host machine. This allows you to persist your database data when the container is stopped or even deleted. postgres is the image we will download, this will be the latest version of PostGreSQL   This comes from www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZDbENJrl4I Another option for the persistence data is just to assign a folder on the host to the default data location inside the container. It may look like -v /[local folder]:/var/lib/postgresql/data  I found that the /pgdata command above persisted but I don\u0026rsquo;t know where it lived on the host machine. It persisted between stopping the container but disappeared after a Docker app update, YMMV.   If you open the Docker dashboard you will see the container running, success!     Connect from the command line  You can connect to the container and get to command line inside of it by executing a command  docker container exec -it pg bash  This brings up bash inside of the container, which is a Linux machine. -it makes it interactive so that you can type into it pg is the name of our container \u0026amp; bash is the command You can type ls to see the contents, which include the folder /pgdata. Type exit     Use psql to make a table  Access psql inside of the container docker container exec -it pg psql -U postgres -U postgres is the user that you use to access the database. Since you are already inside of the container to connect, no password is needed. Create a table at the prompt postgres=#  create table table1(name text, id int generated by default as identity); Then insert some data insert into table1(name) values('PostGreSQL'), ('database'), ('Dbeaver'); Now you have a table in your database that is running within a docker container. Confirm it by typing \\dt       Connect to database with Dbeaver  If you open Dbeaver you can connect to this running database by setting up a PostGreSQL connection. The host will be localhost Database will be postgres Username will be postgres and the password is the one set in the docker command, in this case docker Test the connection with the button, then Finish You should see our table1 under postgres\u0026gt;Schemas\u0026gt;public\u0026gt;Tables To use Dbeaver check out the documentation.   Get PostGreSQL + PostGIS running in a container  For this I use  docker run --name=pgdb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -e PGDATA=/pgdata -d -v gisdata:/pgdata postgis/postgis This uses a named volume managed by Docker at gisdata It doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist so Docker will create it. You can check these with docker volume ls     Connect to database with QGIS  This can be done by right clicking on the PostGIS in the Browser. Once connected you can mange the connection in the DB Browser and do things like import data into the database. Probably best to update to 3.10 at least.    There was a fair amount of Googleing to explore all of this. I had issues arise around connecting to volumes. It is nice to be able to persist data so that you could use this process for learning and analysis. Docker is a good way to keep the environment stable and isolated from whatever machine you are on (I was working on Windows 10 and MacOS).\n","date":1611446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611446400,"objectID":"127726cd63ae2ab246877595df44d1d3","permalink":"/post/docker/","publishdate":"2021-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/docker/","section":"post","summary":"Using Docker for databases.","tags":["database, spatial"],"title":"Working with PostGreSQL and PostGIS in Docker + QGIS","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As part of my postdoc at NC State I am working on the PARC3 - Physical Activity and Recreation in Children in Communities of Color led by Dr. Aaron Hipp and Dr. Myron Floyd. The project involves observations and surveys at parks in New York City and Raleigh-Durham. The bulk of the work was done in 2017 and 2018 and we are analyzing data and writing up our findings as part of my work.\nThe project is part of a broader effort studying physical activity that was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\nProject Description\nPublic parks represent key settings for promoting physical activity among children who are least likely to be active and most likely to be overweight or obese. Parks are generally widely available, offering programs and facilities targeted to young children. Because they are public entities, municipal parks can be influenced by a range of policy actions that affect how they are designed, located, programmed, as well as how they are managed and maintained. Describing park use patterns among different racial and ethnic groups, particularly in low-income neighborhoods, can inform planning decisions on how to meet diverse recreation needs and advance public health goals.\nChildren in kindergarten through 5th grade (as of Spring 2017) are the target population along with one parent or primary caregiver (child/parent dyads). Racial and ethnic populations include African American, Asian, and Latino children and caregivers. Data collection focuses on 20 parks in New York City (Asian and Latino) and 20 neighborhood parks in Raleigh-Durham (African American and Latino). Systematic observations using SOPARC are being used to measure children’s use of parks and park-based physical activity across all 40 parks. Parks, as well as surrounding neighborhoods, are being audited to identify and describe environmental supports for, and barriers to, physical activity. Individual-level physical activity and location data are obtained from in-park surveys, accelerometers, and GPS. A brief telephone survey of neighborhoods near the study parks will identify types of park attributes parents look for when making decisions about their children’s use of parks.\n PARC Website\n","date":1608249600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608249600,"objectID":"37ed7a592bffda28a1d4adb2b29391f3","permalink":"/project/parc/","publishdate":"2020-12-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/parc/","section":"project","summary":"Postdoctoral work at NC State","tags":null,"title":"PARC3 - Physical Activity and Recreation in Children in Communities of Color","type":"project"},{"authors":["Scott Ogletree","Jing Huei Huang","Claudia Alberico","Oriol Marquet","Myron F Floyd","J Aaron Hipp"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"37f03c915db651b4b1e6d07733ab2d2f","permalink":"/publication/parent_pref/","publishdate":"2020-12-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/parent_pref/","section":"publication","summary":"Parents are an important part of children's physical activity in parks.
