Building a website with Rmarkdown

I have built some of it up already.

How to update it all?

From the blowdown book:
If you have no experience in publishing websites before, just log in using your GitHub account or other accounts, drag the public/ folder built by blogdown for your website to the Netlify page, and your website will be online in a few seconds with a random subdomain name
