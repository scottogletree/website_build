Building a website with Rmarkdown

I have built some of it up already.

How to update it all?
----------------------------------------
Once you change some of the markdown files, then rebuild the site
blogdown::build_site()
You can test it locally with - 
blogdown::serve_site(), but remember to stop the server when done blogdown::stop_server()
----------------------------------------
The layout of the page is in website_build/content/home
Each markdown file is a section


The image as avatar:
The shape of the image on the page (circle, square) is in website_build/config/_default/params.toml line 187
The image is at - website_build/content/authors/admin

Years on education:
In this file is where the info on me is -
website_build/content/authors/admin/_index.md
The copy at the top of the page, Interests, links


Setting Google Analytics:

----------------------------------------
Posts
Posts can be stand alone or in folders.


----------------------------------------
The menus at the top of the page are in website_build/config/_default/menus.toml

From the blowdown book:
If you have no experience in publishing websites before, just log in using your GitHub account or other accounts, drag the public/ folder built by blogdown for your website to the Netlify page, and your website will be online in a few seconds with a random subdomain name
